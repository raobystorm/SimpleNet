## SimpleNet ðŸ›¸
This is super tiny neural network for fun!!

## Dataset
Only on Iris now. https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/
<br />
Note this is a very simple dataset. We achieved 100% accuracy on our test split (Random sampled 10% from training set) by one layer Fully-connected 4 X 3 NN with softmax activation.

## Layers:
Fully-connected, Softmax, drop-out.

## Loss function:
Cross-entropy,
Sum-of-squares,

## Optimizer:
Stochastic Gradient Descet

## FutureWork?
COCO Loss, more optimizers

## How to use
Just run jupyter notebook and play as you like
